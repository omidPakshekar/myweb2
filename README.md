# Age Predictor Application 
This project predicts a person's age in a photo or video.
We wrote two models for this project, one with keras and the other with opencv

# Age_net.caffemodel
  This is the model that you must download before running AgeDetection_(Using CV)

## Data
we combined these four datasets and for imdb we use panda to analyze the data
- IMDB     https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/
- Kaggele  https://www.kaggle.com/mariafrenti/age-prediction
- Kaggele  https://www.kaggle.com/frabbisw/facial-age
- Wiki     https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/

## Data analyze
we use panda to analyze data and bring the data out.And crop the images by face detection algorithms 

## Face Detection
We use face detection to recognize face from the image and then crop the face and save to the folder 

*In opencv project we have 8 classes*
- 0-2 years old
- 4-6 years old
- 8-12 years old
- 15-20 years old
- 25-32 years old
- 38-43 years old
- 48-53 years old
- 60-100 years old

*In keras project we have 6 classes*
- 1-5 years old
- 6-16 years old
- 17-30 years old
- 31-50 years old
- 51-70 years old
- 71-100 years old

## Library and widget we use: 
- panda
- imutils
- opencv
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
